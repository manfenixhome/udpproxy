udpproxy allows to proxy UDP flows using Netfilter queuing
capabilities.

For example:
 # iptables -A OUTPUT -p udp --dport 161 \
       --destination 172.16.100.0/23 -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 10
 # udpproxy -e "ssh somehost ./udpproxy" -q 10

The remote udpproxy does not have to run as root. It only uses
unpriviledged operations.

udpproxy does not handle fragmentation at all. If you use programs
that sends large packets, you should create a dummy interface with
a large MTU and route packets to this interface. udpproxy will then
receives the packets unfragmented and forward them to the remote proxy
which will relies on operating system to handle fragmentation.
